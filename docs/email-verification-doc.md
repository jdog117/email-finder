# SMTP Process for Email Verification

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. It's used by mail servers to send and receive emails. In the context of email verification, we use SMTP to verify if an email address exists.

Step-by-step explanation of the SMTP process for email verification:

1. **Connection**: The code creates a connection to the mail server of the domain of the email address on port 25, which is the standard port for SMTP.

2. **Greeting (HELO)**: After the server sends a 220 response to indicate that it's ready, the code sends a `HELO` command to the server with the domain name. This is the initial greeting in the SMTP process.

3. **MAIL FROM**: After the server responds with a 250 status code to the `HELO` command, the code sends a `MAIL FROM` command to the server with an empty sender (`<>`). This command tells the server who's sending the email. In this case, the sender is not important because we're only verifying if an email address exists, so an empty sender is used.

4. **RCPT TO**: After the server responds with a 250 status code to the `MAIL FROM` command, the code sends a `RCPT TO` command to the server with the email address to verify. This command tells the server who the email is for.

5. **Verification**: After the `RCPT TO` command, the server responds with a status code. If the status code is 250 or 251, it means the email address exists. If the status code is anything else, it means the email address does not exist.

6. **Closure**: After the verification, the code closes the connection to the server with the `socket.end()` method.

Please note that this process verifies if an email address exists by checking if the mail server accepts mail for that address. However, it's not 100% accurate because some mail servers accept mail for any address in their domain, even if the address doesn't exist. Also, some mail servers don't allow this kind of verification for privacy or security reasons.
To fix this we will catch the accept all code and make that known to the user.
